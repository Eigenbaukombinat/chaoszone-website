Today is day 0 before congress, the day where most of the assembly build up
happens. We are also working on building a nice and comfy coding place. We
brought a lot of couches from different hackerspaces and lots of good mood.

So if you want to come, see colourful flashy lights, code on a comfy couch or
hang out woth us, you can find us in
[Hall 2](https://34c3.c3nav.de/l/chaoszone/@0,469.58,373.33,5).

I wish you all a nice time at the 34th Chaos Communication Congress.
